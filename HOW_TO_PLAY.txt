==HOW TO PLAY==
Click on the balls on the left side to toggle its state.
Then the balls will feed their electricity towards the gates.
Your goal is to light all the balls on the right up.


==LOGIC GATES INFORMATION==
The state can be either activated or deactivated. (1 or 0)
The logic gates contained in the game are AND, OR, NOT, XOR.

OR symbol is curvy at its base compared to AND.
NOT symbol is a triangle with a circle at the end.
XOR symbol is like OR but with double stroke base.

AND, OR, NOT mechanics are simple so I'm not going to explain it.
XOR is a bit tougher to understand for newbies but I'm gonna tell you an intuition.
XOR is just a gate that is activated whenever there exists only one activated input. ([1 XOR 0] = 1 and vice versa)
In general cases where XOR gates are chained, if the sum of the inputs are odd (1,3,5,7,...), XOR will turn on. 
(See example of chained XOR gates in level 5)

==TROUBLESHOOTING==

- If you download the game (web build) to be run on your PC, please use any browsers except Chrome because it requires the file
  to be uploaded to a server. If you run the game locally on Chrome, it will not work.
