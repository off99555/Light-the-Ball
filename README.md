# Light-the-Ball
A 2D game I designed from scratch built in Unity3D

All you do is click on the input balls to try and activate all the output balls.
The game idea is based on logic gates like AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.

## Disclaimer
The game is far from finished. This is the only prototype version which has only 5 levels of randomness.
